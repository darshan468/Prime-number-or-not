# Prime Number Checker
This is a simple Python script that checks if a number is a prime number. It asks the user for an integer and then tells them if it's prime or not.

# What is a prime number?
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

# How the Code Works
         *The script first takes a number as input from the user.

        *It checks if the number is greater than 1. Prime numbers must be greater than 1.

        *It then uses a for loop to divide the number by all integers from 2 up to the number itself.

        *If the number is divisible by any of these integers, it's not a prime number, and the loop breaks.

        *If the loop finishes without finding any divisors, the number is considered a prime number.

        *Any number less than or equal to 1 is automatically classified as not a prime number.
